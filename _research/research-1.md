My primary PhD research topic was to use a method from experimental neuroscience to characterize
selectivity and adversarial robustness properties of a recurrent neural network implementation of
the sparse coding algorithm. My work demonstrated that we can use a geometric meeasure,
namely the curvature, of the high-dimensional response surface to explain these properties.

You can check out [my blogpost]({{site.url}}/posts/2021-05-18-selectivity-robustness) on the topic for a high-level
overview, or read [the paper](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772000) for the
details.
