<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
We demonstrate by experiment an image storage and compression task by directly storing analog image data onto an analog-valued RRAM array. A joint source-channel coding algorithm is developed with a neural network to encode and retrieve natural images. The encoder and decoder adapt jointly to the statistics of the images and the statistics of the RRAM array in order to minimize distortion. This adaptive joint source-channel coding method is resilient to RRAM array non-idealities such as cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variations, time-dependent variability, and non-functional storage cells, while achieving a reasonable reconstruction performance of ~ 20 dB using only 0.1 devices/pixel for the analog image.
