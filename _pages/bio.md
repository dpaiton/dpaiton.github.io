My name is Dylan Paiton and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Bethge lab](https://bethgelab.org) at the University of T&uuml;bingen in Germany.
I received my PhD in Vision Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I
worked at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/).
Before that I was a post-baccalaureate researcher in
[Garrett Kenyon's group](http://petavision.github.io/) at
[Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://youtu.be/55hlnlVuTpk). I received a Bachelor of Science
degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Optical Sciences from the
[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/eleceng/).

I was born in Maine, USA, and lived there until I was 10. The rest of my adolescence was spent in
Rio Rancho, a town in central [New Mexico, USA](https://explorepartsunknown.com/destination/new-mexico/).
I graduated from Rio Rancho High School in 2007.

<strong>Here is a short bio for talks:</strong>
<br>
Dylan received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology. He then worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher in Garrett
Kenyon's group at Los Alamos National Lab, where he studied biophysical retina models and
hierarchical sparse coding networks. He obtained his PhD in Vision Science from the University of
California, Berkeley under the advisement of Bruno Olshausen. For his PhD thesis he developed an
analysis technique to explain selectivity and robustness properties of a sparse coding neural
network. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in Matthias Bethge's lab at the University of
TÃ¼bingen. Here he is extending his PhD thesis work to discovering novel modes of invariance and
selectivity in biological neurons. He is also supervising students working in the fields of
disentanglement and adversarial robustness.
