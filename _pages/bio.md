My name is Dylan Paiton and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Bethge lab](https://bethgelab.org) at the University of T&uuml;bingen.
I received my PhD in Vision Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I
worked at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/).
Before that I was a post-baccalaureate researcher in
[Garrett Kenyon's group](http://petavision.github.io/) at
[Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://youtu.be/55hlnlVuTpk). I received a Bachelor of Science
degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Optical Sciences from the
[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/eleceng/).

I grew up in central [New Mexico](https://explorepartsunknown.com/destination/new-mexico/), in a
town called Rio Rancho and attended high school at the
[Rio Rancho High School](https://rioranchohigh.rrps.net/home), graduating in 2007.

<strong>Here is a short bio for talks:</strong>

Dylan received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology. He then worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher in Garrett
Kenyon's group at Los Alamos National Lab, where he studied biophysical retina models and
hierarchical sparse coding networks. He obtained his PhD in Vision Science from the University of
California, Berkeley under the advisement of Bruno Olshausen. His PhD thesis was on developing an
analysis technique to explain selectivity and robustness properties of neural networks. He is
currently a postdoctoral researcher in Matthias Bethge's lab at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
His primary research is developing a method for discovering novel modes of invariance and
selectivity in biological neurons. He is also supervising students working in the fields of
disentanglement and adversarial robustness.
