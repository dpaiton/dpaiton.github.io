My name is Dylan Paiton and I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Bethge lab](https://bethgelab.org) at the University of T&uuml;bingen in Germany.
I received my PhD in Vision Science from the University of California, Berkeley, where I
worked at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/).
Before that I was a post-baccalaureate researcher in
[Garrett Kenyon's group](http://petavision.github.io/) at
[Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://youtu.be/55hlnlVuTpk). I received a Bachelor of Science
degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Optical Sciences from the
[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/eleceng/). I was born
in Maine, USA, and lived there until I was 10. The rest of my adolescence was spent in
Rio Rancho, a town in central [New Mexico, USA](https://explorepartsunknown.com/destination/new-mexico/).
I graduated from Rio Rancho High School in 2007.

When I'm not working I love playing outside, especially ultimate frisbee, disc golf, snowboarding,
and hiking. I am also a gamer; I frequently play all sorts of games, from videogames to tabletop.
And these things are always most fun when done with my partner, Christine, and our two dogs

and [Ramsey](https://www.instagram.com/ramseythepup/).

<strong>Here is a short bio for talks:</strong>

Dylan received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology. He then worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher in Dr. Garrett
Kenyon's group at Los Alamos National Lab, where he studied biophysical retina models and
hierarchical sparse coding networks. He obtained his PhD in Vision Science from the University of
California, Berkeley under the advisement of Dr. Bruno Olshausen. For his PhD thesis he developed an
analysis technique to explain selectivity and robustness properties of a sparse coding neural
network. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Matthias Bethge's lab at the University
of TÃ¼bingen. He is extending his PhD thesis work to discover novel modes of invariance and
selectivity in biological neurons. He is also supervising students working in the fields of
disentanglement and adversarial robustness.
